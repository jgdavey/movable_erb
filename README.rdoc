== Description

A simple CSV to MTImport conversion utility. 
Useful for mapping contacts data into individual entries in Movable Type.

MTImport format is simple enough that most blogging platforms can import it, so this utility could ease the pain of moving some older data structure in CSV format into a blog platform.

== Requirements

* fastercsv gem

== Installation

  [sudo] gem install jgdavey-movable_erb

== Usage

MovableErb uses the header names in the first row of 
the CSV file to map to each of the mtimport’s values: 
Title, Body, Extended, Category, and Tags.

So, a CSV file that looks like:
  Title,Body,Extended
  Title of a Post,Body content (can include html, etc),Extended content

will become:
  TITLE: Title of a Post
  -----
  BODY:

  Body content (can include html, etc)

  -----
  EXTENDED:

  Extended content

You can even specify more than one header column as Title, Body, etc.,
and they will be combined into one entity, joined by:
* a comma for one-line attributes (title, author), or 
* a newline for multi-line (Body, Extended)

=== Commandline usage
After installing the gem, just run

  movable_erb [options] yourfile.csv
