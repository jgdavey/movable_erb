several areas of modern optics.
The first article, by U. Keller, discusses the progress which has been made
in recent years in ultrafast pulse generation, using solid-state lasers. In the last
decade, the performance of compact ultrafast solid-state lasers has been improved
by several orders of magnitude in pulse duration, average power, pulse energies
and pulse repetition rates. In this article these and other breakthroughs are discussed.
The article provides both the expert and the non-expert with an overview
of this rapidly advancing field.
The second article, by A. Shchegrov, A. Maradudin and E. Mendez, reviews research
on the scattering of electromagnetic waves from randomly rough surfaces.
Unlike earlier investigations in this field, the article covers the more difficult subject
of multiple scattering from such surfaces and discusses some more recen",01-May-04,135,135,"Preface1. Ultrafast Solid State Lasers (U. Keller)2.

Because of the increasing need for ever better performing materials endowed with specific properties, macromolecular engineering has become a useful tool for designing well-architectured polymers (telomers, telechelics, stars, dendrimers, alternating, block- and graftcopolymers). These polymers are nowadays seeing an enormous growth. Among them, fluoropolymers are seen as high value added materials in many applications ranging from surfactants, optical fibers, biomaterials, coatings, to membranes for fuel cells. Indeed, the relationship between structure of the monomer to the properties of the polymers is of increasing interest so that these properties are tuned for the most appropriate applications.

The articles published here were reviewed by referees selected from specialists in the Femtochemistry community, guaranteeing a collective responsability for the quality of the research reported in the next 564 pages. 
Femtochemistry is an ever-growing field, where new research areas are constantly opening up, and one which both stimulates and accompanies the development of ultrafast technologies. 
The increasing interest in femtobiology and chemistry at the frontier with biology is an obvious indicator of th",01-May-04,175,175,"1. Gas Phase And Clusters.

There was, however, an equally strong emphasis in Edinburgh on key application areas in mass spectrometry like genomics, proteomics, metabonomics; drug metabolism and bioanalysis, discovery pharma, analysis in pharmaceutical development processes; environmental chemistry, food and nutrition, forensics, and engineering materials.

Traditionally, process design and control system design are performed sequentially. It is only recently displayed that a simultaneous approach to the design and control leads to significant economic benefits and improved dynamic performance during plant operation. 

Extensive research in issues such as ?interactions of design and control?, ?analysis and design of plant wide control systems?, ?integrated methods for design and control? has resulted in impressive advances and significant new technologies that have enriched the variety of instruments available for the design engineer in her endeavour to design and operate new processes. The field of integrated process design and control has reached a maturity level that mingles the best from process knowledge and understanding and control theory on one side, with the best from numerical analysis and optimisation on the other.
